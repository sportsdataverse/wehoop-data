But Connecticut won its second consecutive title by taking away Tennessee's inside game. Although the Lady Vols grabbed 40 rebounds to UConn's 22, the Huskies' interior players doubled-down on and outplayed Tennessee's posts, who failed to take advantage of second-chance points and capitalize on all those rebounds.\n<p></p>\nShyra Ely (six points, two rebounds) and Tasha Butts (four points, one rebound) never got going, and never penetrated UConn's defense. Kara Lawson played her heart out, but fellow senior Gwen Jackson, who played so well in the semifinals, never truly seemed to be a factor and wasn't able to step up and take over the game when her team needed it. As a result, Tennessee's offense seemed a little stagnate at times.\n<p></p>\nAnn Strother's performance was incredible, and without her 17 points and clutch 3-pointers, I'm not sure the Huskies would be holding up the championship trophy. Strother forced Tennessee to split its defensive attention between her and Diana Taurasi, who once again handled everything thrown her way. She was sensational, and is the type of player we haven't seen in a long time.\n<p></p>\nUConn's Maria Conlon scored 11 big points, and she benefited from Tennessee focusing on Strother and Taurasi. We know those two can create their own shots, but Conlon shoots better when she gets an open look. Tonight, she just had to be patient and ready when the ball was reversed to her. She obviously was, draining 3 of 5 3-pointers.\n<p></p>\nUConn's defense outside the paint was crucial, too. They ran a box on Lawson, limiting her shots and shading her side of the floor. Tennessee also failed to generate many fast-break opportunities. \n</font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=8><spacer type=block width=8 height=1></td>\n<td width=200 height=4 colspan=2 bgcolor=#ECECE4><spacer type=block width=200 height=4></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<!---------------------INLINE COLUMNIST (END)--------------------->\n\n\t   The fearless junior with the flashy moves proved that UConn\ncould rebuild and still repeat.\n\n\t   Taurasi ignored a sore back and ankle and carried the Huskies to\na 73-68 victory over Tennessee on Tuesday night for their second\nstraight national championship.\n\n\t   She always seems to be at her best against Tennessee, and she\nscored 28 points this time, displaying the poise and passion that\nmade her the national player of the year and the Final Four's most\noutstanding player.\n\n\t   \"She's cut from a different cloth. She's got a lot of Italian\nin her, God bless her,'' said UConn coach Geno Auriemma, himself\nthe son of Italian immigrants.\n\n\t   \"I've never been around anyone who is just immune to the\npressures of the moment and just lives in the moment and has such\njoy and passion for the game and shows it on every possession.''\n\n\t   The Huskies (37-1) won this third title game between the\nnation's two premier programs, and it was mostly because of\nTaurasi, who became the leader on a team that started two freshmen\nand a sophomore.\n\n\t   She made 8-of-15 shots, including four 3-pointers. She scored on\na floater in the lane, a backdoor cut and even threw in a shot\nleft-handed as the Huskies capped a season of improbable success\nthat included a record 70-game winning streak.\n\n\t   \"Before the game coach said, `You guys have to rewrite\nhistory,''' Taurasi said. \"We just did it together. No superstars,\njust blue collar. We just had to do what we were good at, and\nthat's rebound, play defense and take care of the ball.''\n\n\t   Even with Taurasi's brilliance, Tennessee (33-5) still closed\nwith a rush after trailing by 13.\n\n\t   With Connecticut trying to eat up the clock, Tennessee ran off\neight straight points to cut the lead to five.\n\n\t   Later, Brittany Jackson pump faked and then made a 3-pointer as\nshe fell forward, cutting the lead to 70-66 with 1:01 left.\nSuddenly, the Lady Vols had life -- even more so when the scoreboard\nmalfunctioned and showed them leading 66-5. It was quickly\nrepaired.\n\n\t   \"We felt we needed to push the tempo and get some easy\nbaskets,'' Tennessee's Kara Lawson said. \"I definitely looked to\npush it a lot harder than we did the first half. I think that\nhelped us offensively.''\n\n\t   Gwen Jackson's layup drew Tennessee to 71-68 with 21 seconds\nleft and the Lady Vols fouled freshman Ann Strother. But she made\nboth free throws and Ashley Battle intercepted Tennessee's inbounds\npass.\n\n\t   The Huskies moved the ball so quickly that Tennessee could not\nfoul, and fittingly, it ended up in Taurasi's hands. She flung it\ninto the stands at the buzzer -- just as she did last year in San\nAntonio -- and Connecticut began yet another victory celebration.\n\n\t   \"She's the most amazing leader you could ask for, and she just\ntook control,'' Strother said. \"She made me feel like I had to\ncome out and play.''\n\n\t   If any more evidence was needed that Connecticut has supplanted\nTennessee as the nation's top program, this was it.\n\n\t   The title was the fourth overall for the Huskies, who also beat\nTennessee in the 1995 and 2000 championship games and now have\nbeaten the Lady Vols four straight times.\n\n<!---------------------INLINE TABLE (BEGIN)--------------------->\n<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=200 align=right>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=8><spacer type=block width=8 height=1></td>\n<td bgcolor=#1e1564 align=center colspan=1><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2 color=#FFFFFF><b>\nFINAL ANALYSIS\n</b></font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=8><spacer type=block width=8 height=1></td>\n<td bgcolor=#ECECE4 width=184><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>UConn won its second straight title  and third in four years.

Taurasi and Co. made sure it did not\nstrike back.\n\n\t   \"It was a very intense, tough, hard-fought game,'' Summitt\nsaid. \"I thought our team controlled the boards, which I thought\nwas going to be a key to the game. Unfortunately, we couldn't make\nthe shots they did.''\n\n\t   Strother finished with 17 points, and the other freshman\nstarter, Barbara Turner, came up with 10 points on five tough\nbaskets inside.\n\n\t   Maria Conlon, the spunky 5-foot-9 guard, contributed 11 points,\nsix assists and four rebounds for the Huskies.\n\n\t   Those efforts brought another title in what should have been a\nrebuilding year from last season's 39-0 club.\n\n\t   Instead, the UConn machine just kept grinding out victories to\nbecome the third repeat champion, following Tennessee (1996-98) and\nSouthern Cal (1983-84).\n\n\t   They finished with six straight victories after their winning\nstreak was broken by Villanova in the Big East tournament final.\n\n\t   Tennessee, deeper and more experienced, got 18 points from\nLawson, its gritty point guard. Gwen Jackson scored 15 and Brittany\nJackson 13.\n\n\t   But when it ended, Lawson walked slowly to the bench with her\nhead down, her career over without a national title. She and Gwen\nJackson were the team's only seniors.\n\n\t   \"I hurt for them, Summitt said. \"I love Gwen and Kara. They're\nlike my daughters. I know they're going to do great things.''\n\n\t   Connecticut, on the other, might be on a championship roll. The\nHuskies have no seniors, so everyone is back next season.\n\n\t   \"That's the hard part,'' Turner said. \"We've got to keep\nwinning because everyone expects it. They didn't expect it this\nyear.''\n\n\t   Ahead by five at halftime, Connecticut began to take control at\nthe start of the second half, and Taurasi -- naturally -- was the\nkey.\n\n\t   She started the half with a 3-pointer, Turner scored inside and\nConlon hit a 3. Suddenly the lead was up to 11, and not even the\nthousands of orange-clad fans in the Georgia Dome could urge\nTennessee all the way back.\n\n\t   Taurasi converted two three-point plays, one on a\npicture-perfect backdoor cut, to help keep Connecticut comfortably\nahead. Her niftiest basket came when she drove the right baseline\nand made an off-balance, left-handed shot for a 65-54 lead.\n\n\t   \"You've got to give Diana a lot of credit,'' Gwen Jackson said.\n\"She has been playing that way all year. The key to anyone guard\nDiana is you have to bring a big ol' attitude. I think she got a\nlot of open looks and she knocked them down the whole game.''\n\n\t   Just what the Huskies needed to win again.\n\n"
