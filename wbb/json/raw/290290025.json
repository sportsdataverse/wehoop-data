    "story": "BERKELEY, Calif. -- With Devanei Hampton beginning to take some of the scoring load and pressure off California teammate Ashley Walker, the rest of the Pac-10 may have a difficult time chasing down the Golden Bears.\n\nUCLA found that out after pushing Cal (No. 5 ESPN/USA Today, No.7 AP) to the brink in the first half before the Bears' 1-2 scoring punch eventually wore the Bruins down.\n\nWalker overcame a sluggish start to score 17 points, Hampton added 11 points and 12 rebounds and the Bears remained unbeaten in the Pac-10 with a 64-48 win over UCLA on Thursday night.\n\n\"It's going to be tough,\" Bruins first-year coach Nikki Caldwell said. \"Those two really have a presence of ownership in the paint. Walker can really extend you defensively because she's able to step out ... and the one thing that Hampton did that really set the tone was her board play.\"\n\nNatasha Vital had 16 points for the Bears (17-2, 8-0), who won their ninth straight overall, one shy of the team record set in 1981-82 and matched in 1986-87. Cal, which also started 8-0 in the conference last year, has matched the best conference start in school history.\n\nWalker, the Pac-10's leading scorer, has carried the Bears most of the way this season, but Hampton is starting to lighten the load after returning from major knee surgery in the offseason. The Pac-10 Player of the Year as a sophomore in 2006-07, Hampton underwent surgery on her right knee in the offseason and missed the first three games of the season.\n\nAfter playing limited minutes in her first few games back, Hampton has seen her time on the court increase as her health and production have improved.\n\n\"We've been waiting and she's been kind of waiting,\" Cal coach Joanne Boyle said. \"I told her, 'You're ready for this. Don't wait anymore. Go and take it.' \"\n\nWalker, who was the focal point of UCLA's defense in the first half before Hampton's performance opened things up, welcomes the help.\n\n\"Having her back is amazing,\" Walker said. \"We work well together. She's a great rebounder, and it takes off a lot of pressure on me. She was the Pac-10 Player of the Year once so that's what you're looking at. That's what you're always going to see.\"\n\nDoreena Campell scored 13 points for UCLA (14-5, 5-3). The Bruins, who were off to their best start in a decade under Caldwell, were held to 10 points over the final 11 minutes and had their three-game win streak snapped.\n\n\"In the second half, we went away from our defensive scheme, and Walker really stepped up her game and established herself inside, which we didn't have an answer for,\" Caldwell said. \"When you're playing a caliber team like Cal, you have to bring it every possession on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nCal scored a season-low 22 points in the first half and trailed by as much as nine before rallying behind Walker. The Pac-10's leading scorer, Walker had only four points in the first half but went 6-for-8 from the floor in the second half to lead the Bears' comeback.\n\nShe had four points as part of a 7-0 run early in the second half then scored back-to-back baskets to give Cal a 37-31 lead.\n\nWhile Walker was making her shots, UCLA went more than 4 minutes without a basket and lost control of the game. Campbell scored 11 straight points for the Bruins, who were within 41-38 with 10:11 remaining before their offense struggled.\n\nCal went on an 11-2 run before sealing the game with a 7-0 run late to beat the Bruins for the fourth straight time.\n\nThe Bears stumbled over themselves in the first half, committing five turnovers in the first 5 minutes while missing nine of their first 11 shots. Walker, the Pac-10 leading scorer, was held scoreless for more than 16 minutes, and California shot just 28.6 percent (8-for-28) from the floor, making only 2 of 14 3-pointers.\n\nUCLA led 11-2 and was ahead by five when Walker made two shots in an 6-0 spurt, the second of which put Cal ahead 22-21 late in the half. But Darxia Morris scored on a short jumper with one minute left, and the Bruins took a 23-22 lead into halftime.\n\n"
