    "story": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas coach Jody Conradt spent a week dismissing the 800-victory milestone as just another step in the quest for a Big 12 championship.\n\n<photo1>\n\nBut when it finally happened, she couldn't avoid being caught up\nin the moment.\n\nConradt became just the second women's basketball coach to win\n800 games, getting there Wednesday night when the Longhorns (No. 16 ESPN/USA Today, No. 17 AP) beat No. 7 Texas Tech 69-58.\n\nMaybe it was the emotion of greeting dozens of former players who came to see her win. Or maybe it was the bucket of confetti dumped on her head.\n\nWhatever it was, Conradt finally embraced just what it meant to be in the game long enough to win 800 times.\n\n\"If there ever was an occasion that was about team, it's this one, because 800 times, young women just like these have gotten on the court and fought for the University of Texas and come out victorious,'' she said.\n\nStacy Stephens had 16 of her 20 points in the second half, and\nHeather Schreiber had 15 points and a career-high 15 rebounds as\nTexas (12-4, 5-0) snapped Tech's 15-game winning streak and stayed\nin first place in the conference.\n\n<!---------------------PULL-QUOTE TABLE (BEGIN)--------------------->\n<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=4><spacer type=block width=3 height=1></td>\n<td><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=4><b>\u201c</b></font></td>\n<td width=225><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=4><b>I hope that when I decide not to coach anymore that it won't be about number of wins. I hope it will be about a little contribution, the same contribution a lot of people made early on to try to provide opportunities for young people.</b></font><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=4><b> \u201d</b></font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=4><spacer type=block width=3 height=1></td>\n<td></td>\n<td width=225><font face=\"Times,serif\"><i>\u2014 </i></font><font face=\"Times,serif\"><i>Jody Conradt</i></font></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<!---------------------PULL-QUOTE TABLE (END)--------------------->\n\n\nConradt joined Tennessee's Pat Summitt (802) as the only women's coaches in the 800-victory club. Summitt got in Jan. 14 with a win over DePaul.\n\nThe 61-year-old Conradt is 800-262 in 34 seasons, with one national championship. She and Summitt started the season tied at 788 wins.\n\nAfter the final buzzer sounded, Stephens dumped the water bucket full of confetti on her coach's head, the crowd chanted \"Jody, Jody, Jody,'' and Longhorns players mugged for courtside television cameras.\n\n\"Texas Tech is always a formidable foe,'' said Conradt, who in 1988 got her 500th win in a game against the Lady Raiders. \"But this is Texas' night and we're going to celebrate.''\n\nOnly three Division I men's coaches -- North Carolina's Dean\nSmith, Kentucky's Adolph Rupp and Jim Phelan of Mount St. Mary's -- have 800 or more wins. Texas Tech coach Bob Knight is close with 798.\n\nSmith retired in 1997 with a record 879 victories.\n\nConradt's 800th victory was a tense battle between Big 12\nrivals. The Longhorns led for the entire game but didn't have it\nsecured until clutch free-throw shooting in the final minute.\n\nJia Perkins and Plenette Pierson led Texas Tech (15-2, 4-1) with\n16 points each.\n\nStephens, 1-of-8 from the floor in the first half, hit her first three shots after the break in a scoring outburst that gave the Longhorns a 36-25 lead.\n\nSchreiber, who also had a tough shooting night, made up for it\nwith tenacious rebounding and two key baskets in the final four\nminutes.\n\n\"I kept looking at the score and we were winning, which was the\nmain goal,'' Schreiber said. \"I decided I had to come up with some\nkey plays.''\n\nTexas led 54-51 before Schreiber turned around Pierson with a slick spin move in the lane and scored. She followed it with another layup to give the Longhorns a 58-51 cushion with 3:33 to play.\n\nThe Lady Raiders, who committed 20 turnovers, had to resort to\nsending Texas to the foul line in the final minute. The Longhorns\nhit eight free throws to seal it. Texas also dominated the\nrebounding, 46-36.\n\nTexas is 10-0 at home.\n\n\"This is absolutely phenomenal,'' said junior guard Jamie Carey, who transferred from Stanford to play for Conradt. \"She really is a pioneer for women's basketball.''\n\nConradt started her career in 1969, coaching for free at Sam\nHouston State in an era when women played 6-on-6 with only two\nplayers allowed to play full court.\n\nShe moved to Texas in 1976 and quickly turned the Longhorns into\na national power. Her 1986 squad was the first undefeated national champion.\n\nIn 1997, Conradt was the first women's coach to 700 victories. In 2001, she was the first to work 1,000 games. She was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\n\"I don't remember a lot of the 800,'' Conradt said. \"I hope that when I decide not to coach anymore that it won't be about number of wins.\n\n\"I hope it will be about a little contribution, the same contribution a lot of people made early on to try to provide opportunities for young people.''\n\nConradt also served 10 years as the Texas women's athletic director, ushering the program through an era of expansion. She gave up those duties in April 2001 to concentrate on basketball. The result was the team's first run to the round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament in 11 years in 2002.\n\n\"She's done a lot for women's basketball,'' Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp said. \"I have a lot of respect for her.''\n\n"
