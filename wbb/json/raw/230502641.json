    "story": "LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- When it came to Wednesday's milestone\nvictory, Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp was realistic. But her\nplayers were euphoric about her 500th win.\n\n\t   \"I have to speak for all the others, because coach Sharp is an\nextremely humble person,'' said junior guard Natalie Ritchie. \"But\nfrom the beginning, she took this program and had a vision for it.\nShe's done so many things for women's basketball. She's the reason\na lot of us play, and it's an honor to play for her and an honor to\nbe a part of this.''\n\n<!---------------------INLINE TABLE (BEGIN)--------------------->\n<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=200 align=right>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=8><spacer type=block width=8 height=1></td>\n<td bgcolor=#735721 align=center colspan=1><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2 color=#FFFFFF><b>\nSHARP SHOOTER\n</b></font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=8><spacer type=block width=8 height=1></td>\n<td bgcolor=#ECECE4 width=184><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A look at the milestone wins in Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp's career:\n\n<b>1:</b> Texas Tech 78, Abilene Christian 64, Nov. 19, 1982<br>\n<b>100:</b> Texas Tech 73, SMU 59, Jan. 19, 1987<br>\n<b>200:</b> Texas Tech 75, Texas A&M 69, Feb. 1, 1992<br>\n<b>242:</b> Texas Tech 84, Ohio State 82, April 4, 1993; Lady Raiders\nwin NCAA title<br>\n<b>300:</b> Texas Tech 90, Houston 69, March 10, 1995<br>\n<b>400:</b> Texas Tech 83, Colorado 71, Feb. 24, 1999<br>\n<b>500:</b> Texas Tech 59, Oklahoma 48, Feb. 19, 2003\n\n<i>--The Associated Press</i>\n</font></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<!---------------------INLINE TABLE (END)--------------------->\n\n\t   Sharp became the 22nd NCAA Division I women's coach to reach the\n500-victory mark as the Lady Raiders (No. 9 ESPN/USA Today, No. 8 AP) overcame a\nnine-point first-half deficit to defeat Oklahoma 59-48.\n\n\t   \"It has not been as big a factor for me as just winning games\nthis year,'' said Sharp, who along with her players wore a pin that\nread simply \"Tech pride, Marsha Sharp, 500 Wins.''\n\n\t   \"At the same time, I don't want this to pass by without\nthinking about a lot of people who have been involved in this. I've\ntold several people this week that this program is bigger than one\nperson.\n\n\t   \"The fans have been so awesome. We've coached a lot of terrific\nkids, and my staff has just been outstanding. I'm really proud of\nthis milestone for the program, because 500 wins at one program in\nthis day and time is a big thing.''\n\n\t   Immediately following the game, Tech athletic director Gerald\nMyers presented Sharp with a plaque and praised a program she has\nbuilt from the ground up into one of the nation's most consistent\nover the past two decades.\n\n\t   Plenette Pierson scored 23 points as Texas Tech (21-3, 10-2 Big\n12) bounced back from Saturday's conference loss at Baylor.\n\n\t   Sharp has a career record of 500-156 (.762 winning percentage)\nin 21 seasons with the Lady Raiders. Her 500th win came in the same\nbuilding where Tech's Bob Knight earlier this month won his 800th\ngame, becoming just the fourth NCAA Division I men's coach to reach\nthat plateau.\n\n\t   Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale congratulated Sharp.\n\n\t   \"That's quite a milestone. I figured if I coached until I was\n97, I'd have a shot at it,'' Coale said. \"She's a classy lady, one\nof the best in the business, and I'm really happy for her.''\n\n\t   Oklahoma (15-10, 6-6) has lost all six of its games against Top\n10 teams this season.\n\n\t   Sharp, 50, has already clinched her 14th straight 20-win season.\nShe has led the Lady Raiders to 16 NCAA tournaments, including the\nlast 13, and their only national championship in 1993 when Sheryl\nSwoopes was playing.\n\n\t   \"It feels great to be a part of this,'' said Tech freshman\nLaToya Davis. \"Even though coach Sharp might jump down your\nthroat, when she yells at you, it's because you know she cares.''\n\n\t   Oklahoma held a 31-27 lead with 16:12 to play following a\n3-point basket by Chelsi Welch, who led the Sooners with 23 points.\nThe Lady Raiders took control with 14 straight points in a\nfour-minute span to lead 41-31.\n\n\t   \"I think when we got on that run, we got the crowd involved,''\nSharp said, \"and they energized us on the defensive end. We were\nable to turn some defensive efforts into offense.''\n\n\t   Pierson and Jolee Ayers combined to score the first nine points\nof the run before Natalie Ritchie hit a 3-pointer that pushed the\nTech lead to 39-31. Erin Grant capped the run with a 12-foot\njumper.\n\n\t   \"I thought the 3-pointer by Ritchie was really one of the\nbiggest plays of the game,'' Sharp said.\n\n\t   \"They're the No. 8 team in the country,'' said Coale. \"We came\nin here wanting to win this game, and we played that way throughout\nthe first half. But if you can beat the No. 8 team on their home\nfloor, then that's gravy.''\n\n\t   The Sooners never got closer than seven points the rest of the\ngame.\n\n\t   Oklahoma had just a 25-23 lead at halftime after Welch hit a\nbaseline jumper for the last of her 12 first-half points.\n\n\t   Earlier this season, Tennessee coach Pat Summitt and Texas coach\nJody Conradt won their 800th games, with Conradt's coming in a\nvictory over Texas Tech. They are the only women's coaches with\nmore than 800 wins.\n"
